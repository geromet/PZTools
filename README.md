A desktop viewer and 'editor' for Project Zomboid loot distribution files.
Updated for Build 42(.14.0) Unstable.

Point it at your game folder (or a mod folder) and browse the full `Distributions.lua` and                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
`ProceduralDistributions.lua` tables — every room, bag, cache, profession loot table, and
procedural list — with search, filtering, and undo/redo 'editing'.

## Features
  - **Parse error reporting** — non-fatal parse issues are listed with line context so mod problems
    are easy to track down
  - **Filter by type** — quickly narrow to Rooms, Bags, Caches, Professions, or Procedural lists
    using the pill buttons
  - **Distribution detail** — see item rolls, container count, flags (Shop / No Ammo), and every
    nested container with its full item/junk chance tables

## Disclaimer
  - **Doesn't** edit anything yet. Mainly made this to find and fix errors.
